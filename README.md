The Procedural Objects mod, created by SimonRyr, is a mod that allows to edit props and buildings' all vertices positions by converting them into procedural objects. It also adds two props, a cube and a square that can also be converted to procedural objects and textured with the texture of the player's choice. And thanks to the vertex customization features that the mod has, the texture is being repeated when the model is stretched.
